### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ghasif Syed, a Master's graduate in Artificial Intelligence with incredible enthusiasm for future technologies!

ðŸ’» I build full-stack apps, ML solutions, and cool interactive projects.

ðŸ’¡ One project I'm incredibly proud of is a full-stack computer vision parking app I built for my Capstone. Check it out [here](https://github.com/ghasifs/leopardspot-parking-monitor)
